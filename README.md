Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical metric in the business world, especially in the telecommunications industry. 
It represents the loss of customers or subscribers, resulting in lost monthly subscription fees and potential future revenue. 
High churn rates can lead to financial instability and hinder growth.
Therefore, itâ€™s vital for telco companies to identify patterns in churn data to reduce acquisition costs and improve customer satisfaction.
